# XenMiner UI Wrapper

Welcome to the XenMiner UI Wrapper, a Python-based user interface for XenMiner. This tool simplifies the process of setting up and running the XenMiner by providing a user-friendly interface that seamlessly works across Linux, macOS, and Windows.

## Features

1. **User-Friendly Interface**: No need to tinker with the code or command line. Set your Ethereum address and other options directly from the UI.
2. **Automatic Script Update**: The application fetches the latest version of Jack's XenMiner script from GitHub everytime you press the Run button, ensuring you're always using the most recent and optimized version.
3. **Ethereum Address Swap**: Automatically replaces Jack's Ethereum address with yours, ensuring that mining rewards go directly to your account.
4. **One-Click Execution**: Run the miner script (as many times as your computer can handle) with just one click.
5. **Parallel Execution**: Execute the miner as many times as the physical CPU cores on your computer, maximizing your mining potential.
6. **Cross-Platform**: Written in Python, this tool is platform-independent and should be able to run on Windows (confirmed), Linux (Ubuntu confirmed) and macOS.

## Getting Started

1. Ensure you have Python 3.x and pip3 installed on your system.
2. Then pip install -U -r requirements.txt 
3. Clone or download the repository.
4. Run the `XenMiner UI Wrapper` script.
5. Enter your Ethereum address, enter path to your Python executable and select other options as needed.
6. Click on the "Run" button to start mining.
